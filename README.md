# Chef/Ansible template maker

A common pattern when creating templates for configuration management systems
is to copy the config file, and add placeholders for each value you want to
be able to configure. A problem arises however when you decide that some value
that was hardcoded now needs to be configurable, and you need to edit the
template. One way to prevent this situation is to templatize every possible
configuration variable in a file at the outset, but this is incredibly time
consuming and rarely done. This script is an attempt to speed up that
procedure for some types of configuration files, and in the ideal case, fully
automate the process of making a template from a configuration file.

The script takes a standard config file, and a set of regular expressions to
match configuration items, and generates a templated version of the same file
along with a companion attributes/default.rb file to drop into a cookbook
(defaults/main.yml for ansible). It works best with configuration files that
consist of large amounts of key/value pairs, but will work with anything that
you can match using regular expressions.

## Pattern file

The logic of the program is in the parameters file. This file consists of
regular expression/action pairs. Each line in the config file is tested
against the regular expression, and the specified action is taken on the first
matching line.

Currently, the allowed actions are:

 * skip - prints the line unmodified - use this to match commented out lines
 * template - convert the line into a template. This action can take 'filters'
   as parameters, which will convert the key used in the vars file
   appropriately:
   * camel_to_underscore - the 'key' value should be converted from CamelCase
     to underscore_case in the attributes.rb.
   * underscore_to_camel - the reverse of camel_to_underscore, if you prefer
     your keys to be in CamelCase.

For template actions, the pattern must contain two matching groups. The first
matching group identifies the key that will be used in the chef
attributes/default.rb (or ansible vars) file, and the second should surround
the value, which will be extracted and put in the attributes file.

## Examples

Templatize sshd_config:

    ./template_maker.py -p template_kv.txt -f test/sshd_config

The same, but for ansible:

    ./template_maker.py -p template_kv.txt -f test/sshd_config -t ansible

Running tests:

    python -m doctest [-v] template_maker.py
